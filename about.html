                <p>Taylor Shepard is an elementary school teacher at Sontag Elementary School in Franklin County, Virginia. 
                    She is twenty-seven years old and from Snow Creek, Virginia, though she currently resides in Martinsville, 
                    Virginia. She studied early childhood education at Patrick Henry College and previously worked as the Children’s 
                    Program Coordinator for the Bassett Library. Taylor considers holding this position and making a difference in the 
                    lives of her student's to be one of her greatest accomplishments. In her free time, Taylor enjoys the hobbies of 
                    crafting and reading, and even hopes to one day finish and publish her in progress novel. Taylor also enjoys 
                    travelling and plans to travel to Italy one day. She relaxes by listening to soft jazz while reading a good novel. 
                    Her favorite recent reads are The First Day of Spring by Nancy Tucker and Becoming by Michelle Obama. While crafting, 
                    Taylor enjoys making quilts, seasonal decorations, and clothing items (sometimes even for her pets). 
                    Over the last several years, Taylor has been on an upward trajectory both in personal and professional life that trend 
                    doesn’t appear to be going anywhere. </p>
